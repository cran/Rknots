\title{Compute the HOMFLY polynomial of a polygonal link
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Given the skein tree (generated by \code{skeinIterator}), 
compute the HOMFLY polynomial of the polygonal link.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
HOMFLYpolynomial(leaves, tree, skein.sign)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
	\item{leaves}{a list containing the binary indices of the 
	tree leaves}
	\item{tree}{a list containing the skein tree as 
	returned by \code{skeinIterator}. }
	\item{skein.sign}{the skein sign to be used (+1 or -1)}
%%     ~~Describe \code{points3D} here~~
%%     ~~Describe \code{ends} here~~
}
\details{The polynomial computation relies on \code{rSymPy}. 
Please notice that the first time sympy is invoked is expected to be 
much slower than subsequent ones. 
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
the HOMFLY polynomial (as string)
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%% ...

\note{
If you wish to compute the polynomial 
directly from the polygonal link points, the function \code{findKnot} 
is what you are looking for. The same applies for the function \code{findProteinKnot}
in the case you are looking for an automated processing of PDB files.
